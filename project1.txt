My background varies because I have worked in 10 different industries.  From Child Care to Financial Services, I have done it all.  This diversity was especially important when deciding to start my own business.  After the housing crisis of 2009, my stable banking job came to a screeching halt and I had to find some way to make sustainable income.  After searching for a decent job for months, I came to the realization that I needed a degree or to become a small business owner.  Shortly after, Beck-n-Call Global was born.

Beck-N-Call Global was a personal concierge services that offered assistance with anything from short term Nanny services to Medical Coding and Billing.  Starting my own business gave me deeper understanding of the profession services that I provided my clients every day, but I was also exposed to what really makes a business thrive or die. This exposure later played a large role in selecting my major at Illinois Tech.  After dissolving the corporation, I knew that I had to pursuit a formal education to remain relevant and competitive in the workforce.

I enrolled in an engineering studies program at Chicago State University, and transferred to IIT 3 semesters ago.  While at CSU I was able to participate in several hackathons.  I found out that I have a knack for coding and that I really like it!  I think that it is extremely important not only consume technology but to also create it.  While at IIT I plan to continue to take as many programming classes that my schedule allows so that I can become a more proficient coder.  Currently, Iâ€™m purely self-taught but excited that will change after COM 330/530.  I am also hoping to create a beautifully designed portfolio to show case some of my mobile app ideas and eventually other websites that I have created.
